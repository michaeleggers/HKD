✔ Cleanup Texturecode @done(24-01-24 13:51)

✔ Render animated IQM models @started(24-01-27 23:31) @done(24-01-28 16:02) @lasted(16h31m4s)
✔ Stop frametime @done(24-01-28 16:02)
☐ Write blogpost on how vertex-skinning works
☐ Set the basepath (usually executable path) for all subsystems. So fileloading doesn't have to be like: LoadIQM((exePath + "../../assets/models/mrfixit/mrfixit.iqm").c_str()); but rather just LoadIQM(mrfixit.iqm);
✔ Have a game class that operates only on the subsystems (renderer, input-system, etc.) that is given to it. So the game-code acts on all the custom library functions and does not care about renderer implementation or Operating System stuff @done(24-01-24 15:14)
☐ Let usercode create entities
✔ Create camera class @done(24-01-30 01:17)
✔ Read and implement Input code @started(24-01-29 17:14) @done(24-01-29 18:39) @lasted(1h25m11s)
☐ Space optimization: If the same model (IQM) is loaded twice. Use the existing VBO, VAO
☐ Move Render API into game. The user should be able to do render-stuff him/herself.
☐ Load Quake .MAP files as levels and render them.
☐ Run around with player
✔ Add mouse-input @done(24-01-30 18:12)
☐ Use mouse to control debug camera

- BUGS:
✔ When SDLK_TAB is used to toggle wireframe then some WASD keys get disabled. @done(24-01-30 01:39) (Problem was TAB key triggering imgui slider-values)
